What you need to compile and use this code:

1. Visual Studio 2019 Community or better

2. MOD Plugin library & DLL (incuded)

3. MOD Plugin header (incuded)

As usual, I do not accept responsibility for any effects, adverse or otherwise, that this code may have on you, your computer, your sanity, your dog, and anything else that you can think of. Use it at your own risk. Have fun.
